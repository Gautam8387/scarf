# How to contribute

## Contributions through pull requests:
If you would like to add a new feature, fix a bug or make some improvements please
follow this [guideline]. Usually when planning to add a new feature it is a good
idea to introduce the proposed feature and discuss it. This can be done on the [discussion
page]. The code is written using [black] style. Please make sure you blacken any edited files. 

## Testing locally
You can run the tests locally on your branch by running [pytest]. The configurations
for pytest are already set in `pyproject.toml`. The extra requirements for running the
tests can be installed from the `requirements.txt` file that is under the 'tests' folder.

## Contributions to the documentation
You may contribute to the documentation by either adding new sections or modifying existing
sections. All the required packages for building the documentation locally can be installed
from another `requirements.txt` file that is under the 'docs' directory. The documentation is built
using [Sphinx]. The markdown files are parsed using [MyST] parser. If you want to add a notebook
to  the documentation then please convert your `ipynb` files to `markdown` format using [Jupytext].
The markdown files are saved with extension `mdnb` so that they can be recognized by [nbshpinx]
extension.
